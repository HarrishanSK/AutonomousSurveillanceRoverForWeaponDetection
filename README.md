# Autonomous Surveillance Rover For Weapon Detection
I build an Autonomous Surveillance Rover for Real-Time Weapon Detection for my MSc in Artificial Intelligence project.
This was done using a range of sensors for autonomous line following and object detection.

- Designed and created an autonomous rover to assist authorities and help reduce the police response time when or before a potential crime happens.  A model surveillance rover with a robotic camera arm was built with the ability to: roam an area via autonomous line following, detect guns in its surroundings, and be controlled remotely over the internet. 

- Created a custom line centring algorithm which proved to be effective and 2 times more power efficient over typical line following approaches.

- Used TensorFlow and python to train a SSD Mobilenet v2 Neural Network to detect weapons in real-time with high accuracy on  a Raspberry Pi.

Code will be uploaded as soon as the dissertation has been marked.
